# Credit_Risk_Analysis

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter.

With an understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services, we explore how to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers. We use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

We also try understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  These can be utilised for portfolio and risk assessment.
